# Asteroids

Just my version of Asteroids. I heard from quite a few people in games that
a great way to get started was to remake old games, specifically Asteroids as
it's extremely simple compared to games that exist today, so here we are.

## TODO

### Ship

- load in the ship
- move ship forward and rotate with arrow keys (no reverse)
- draw other sprites on top of the ship
